# Intelligent Performance

In this example, you will learn how SQL Server and Azure SQL have intelligent performance capabilities to help make your application faster and give you performance insights anytime, anywhere.

## Requirements

All these examples run with SQL Server 2019 and Azure SQL Database and Managed Instance. The examples use both T-SQL scripts you can run with SSMS or in the first example a T-SQL notebook you can use with Azure Data Studio.

These examples require the WideWorldImporters database sample which you can restore from https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/wide-world-importers-v1.0/WideWorldImporters-Full.bak. A sample script to restore the database called **restorewwi.sql** is provided.

## Steps

There are two scenarios you can use in the following folders:

**iqp** - This is an example of Intelligent Query Processing.

**lwp** - This is an example of Lightweight Query Profiling.
