Access detailed content and examples on Azure SQL, a set of cloud services that allows for SQL Server to be deployed in the cloud. This book teaches the fundamentals of deployment, configuration, security, performance, and availability of Azure SQL from the perspective of these same tasks and capabilities in SQL Server. This distinct approach makes this book an ideal learning platform for readers familiar with SQL Server on-premises who want to migrate their skills toward providing cloud solutions to an enterprise market that is increasingly cloud-focused.

Author Bob Ward is a leading expert with access to and support from the Microsoft engineering team that built Azure SQL and related database cloud services. He presents powerful, behind-the-scenes insights into the workings of one of the most popular database cloud services in the industry.

The examples for this book are available through scripts in folders on this GitHub repo. They are provided as a reference for you to use as a compliment while reading the book. You need to read the chapters of the book to see instructions, with example output, on how to use these examples. In some cases, example commands are provide *inline* in the book itself. Many chapters have examples based on step-by-step usage of the Azure Portal and therefore there are not as many script examples. You will need an Azure subscription for all of the examples.
