# Migration demo

- Deploy a Azure SQL Managed Instance. Use any region but deploy the business critical tier. I used 8 vCores but any number of CPUs will work.

- Deploy a SQL Server. I used an Azure VM running SQL Server 2017.

- Install Azure Data Studio latest insiders build

- Install the Azure SQL Migration extension
