# AI features for SQL Server 2025

These are demos for new AI buit-in capabilities in SQL Server 2025. This includes AI model definition, vector data type, embedding generation, vector index, and vector search.

Demos include examples for AI models hosted by Azure OpenAI, Ollama, and an OpenAI compatible endpoint.

## Pre-requisites

Here are the minimum requirements to run the demos:

- SQL Server 2025 Preview using Evaluation or Developer Editions.
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 21 installed from https://aka.ms/ssms21

2. All demos will use the same database to show the differences with AI model capabilities Therefore, you will need to download the sample database AdventureWorks from <https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorks2022.bak>.

There may be other prerequisites for specific demos. Please refer to the individual demo instructions for details.
